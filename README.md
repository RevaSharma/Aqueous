# Aqueous
**For my ENGR 100 Design Session course at Bucknell University, I have designed a prototype for an app called "Aqueous".
This app has been created in order to improve water sustainability, specifically in households.** 

Aqueous works in conjunction with a water meter sensor, that can be attached to pipes insides homes. This meter has inbuilt ultrasonic sensors that measures the amount of water flowing inside the pipes. Through bluetooth technology, the meter conveys information about the household water consumption to the app. 

**The main features of Aqueous are:**
1. After receiving information from the water meter, the app displays data regarding a household's average weekly, monthly and yearly water usage in form of easy-to-read graphs.
2. The app also collects data regarding the surrounding neighbor's average water consumption and compares your household consumption against theirs.  
3. The surrounding neighbor's average water consumption is displayed on the graph as a horizontal line called "level of sustainability". If you cross this, it is an indication that you are consuming more than the average level of water consumption in your area. 
4. The app provides water sustainability tips that can be easily applied in households. Conscious users can see visible reductions in their consumption and water bills. 
5. Aqueous Kids is a child-friendly version of the app. It focusses on educating children about being water responsible from an early age through simple and engaging quizzes, while simultaneously entertaining them. 


**The current prototype of Aqueous has the following 14 app screens:**
1. Main app screen with Aqueous logo and login and sign up buttons
2. User login and Aqueous Kids login screen
3. Sign up screen
4. Menu screen
5. Connect your water meter sensor to the app screen (using bluetooth)
6. Track you water consumption screen- Buttons to track your household's weekly, monthly and yearly consumption 
7. Track and compare your weekly water consumption with your neighbors screen 
8. Track and compare your monthly water consumption with your neighbors screen 
9. Track and compare your yearly water consumption with your neighbors screen 
10. Tips to improve water sustainability in households screen
11. Aqueous Kids intro screen
12. Aqueous Kids quiz game screen
13. About screen
14. Feedback screen


**The app colors, font type and font sizes for Aqueous have been carefully thought out. The rationale behind making these particular choices is as follows:**

**App colors:**
1. Shades of blue and cream have been used in the app screens (Exact shades of blue and cream have been annotated on the app using corresponding hexadecimal values).
2. According to IRIS statistics, about 8% of all men and 0.5% of all women suffer from color blindness. Analysis shows that blue is the only color detectable to those suffering from color blindness. 
3. Hues of blue have a calming effect on the eyes and are well rendered on most mobile devices. 
4. Cream has been used as the background for most screens as it is neutral, calm and easy on the eyes (as compared to a white background). Most text/images/graphs are visible on a cream colored screen.

**Font type:**
1. Glacial Indifference and Helvetica (for the graphs) have been used in the app screens.
2. Glacial Indifference is a geometric sans serif inspired font. Sans serif fonts are a practical design choice as they have slightly better readability as compared to serif fonts. 
3. This font has been designed while keeping in mind responsive typography, which is optimal for use in apps as it facilitates legibility.
4. Helvetica has been used to display information on graphs. This is also a sans serif inspired font that is generally used in graphs as it makes texts legible from distance in large size. 

**Font size:**
1. 4 font sizes- 20px, 16px, 14px, 12px have been used in the app screens.
2. 16px is the default font size in many apps, as most paragraphs, labels and menus are legible at this size.
3. These sizes are readable from the phone when held at a reasonable distance from the eyes.
4. The rationale behind using only 4 font sizes throughout is that it makes the app look professional, uncluttered and structured.

**1. The first pdf contains all the 14 app screens.**

**2. The second pdf contains annotations regarding app colors, font types and font sizes on all the 14 app screens.**
